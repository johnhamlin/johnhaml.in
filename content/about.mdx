<SectionHeading>About me</SectionHeading>

I build tools that make people's lives easier, currently at **Deutsche Bank**, where I'm **overhauling legacy code bases** to use modern, maintainable tools and technologies. That includes implementing a **micro-frontend architecture** to refactor monolithic apps into modular services, enabling CI/CD by multiple scrum teams working in multiple languages and frameworks.

As a former journalist, I enjoy **writing documentation** that distills **complex topics** into **plain English**. As a senior comms consultant at North Carolina's largest county, I led **cross-functional teams of engineers** to craft **customer-focused** outreach and marketing campaigns.

When I’m not writing code, I’m a **bar trivia** champion, **hot sauce** daredevil and **kombucha** home brewer. I'll talk your ear off about **reverse searing steaks**, the best way to make a **martini** (obviously gin, almost no vermouth) and the uselessness of the Oxford comma.
