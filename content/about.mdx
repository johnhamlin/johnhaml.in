<SectionHeading>About me</SectionHeading>

I build full stack apps. Right now I'm working on **xkite** at the OS Labs tech accelerator, where we're building tools to make life easier for developers using **Apache Kafka**.

I enjoy writing documentation that distills complex topics into plain English. I've led **cross-functional teams** of engineers to craft **customer-focused** outreach and marketing campaigns. I honed my writing as a newspaper reporter, where I covered everything from the local Ham & Yam Festival to [global billion-dollar deals](https://archive.is/E4Sel).

When I’m not writing code, I’m a bar trivia champion, hot sauce connoisseur and kombucha home brewer. Not to toot my own horn, but I’ve been known to solve a Saturday NYT crossword and I can reverse-sear a ribeye to perfection.
