<SectionHeading>About me</SectionHeading>

I build tools that make people's lives easier, most recently at **xkite**, where we created open-source tools that make life easier for **Apache Kafka** devs.

As a former journalist, I enjoy **writing documentation** that distills **complex topics** into **plain English**. As a senior comms consultant at North Carolina's largest county, I led **cross-functional teams of engineers** to craft **customer-focused** outreach and marketing campaigns.

When I’m not writing code, I’m a **bar trivia** champion, **hot sauce** masochist and **kombucha** home brewer. I'll talk your ear off about **reverse searing steaks**, the best way to make a **martini** (obviously gin, almost no vermouth) and the uselessness of the Oxford comma.
