I build apps that make people's lives easier. At **Deutsche Bank**, our team has used _React_, _TypeScript_, _GraphQL_ and _Redux_ to drive the development of a next-generation platform for onboarding investment banking clients using. By implementing modern functional React patterns, optimizing _Webpack_ and _Babel_ for faster load times, and leveraging AI tools like _GitHub CoPilot_, we've accelerated development cycles and enhanced user experiences. Migrating _Kubernetes microservices_ and _CI/CD pipelines_ to _Google Cloud_ has positioned the platform for scalability and innovation.

When I'm not writing code, I'm a **bar trivia** champion, **hot sauce** daredevil and **kombucha** home brewer. I'll talk your ear off about **reverse searing steaks**, the best way to make a **martini** (obviously gin, almost no vermouth) and the uselessness of the Oxford comma.
